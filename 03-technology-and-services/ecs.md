# AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## What is AWS ECS?

AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a **fully managed container orchestration service** that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Docker containers. ECS eliminates the need to install and operate your own container orchestration software.

**Key Concept:** ECS follows a cluster-based model where you define how your containers should run, and AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, scheduling, and scaling automatically.

## Core Components

### 1. Clusters
**Definition:** A logical grouping of compute resources (EC2 instances or Fargate) where your containers run

**Cluster Types:**
- **EC2 Launch Type** - You manage EC2 instances in the cluster
- **Fargate Launch Type** - AWS manages the underlying infrastructure
- **External Launch Type** - Use on-premises servers or other cloud providers

### 2. Task Definitions
**Definition:** A blueprint that describes how containers should run, similar to a Docker Compose file

**Task Definition Components:**
- **Container definitions** - Docker image, CPU, memory, port mappings
- **Task role** - IAM permissions for containers
- **Network mode** - How containers communicate
- **Volume definitions** - Persistent or shared storage

### 3. Services
**Definition:** Ensures a specified number of task instances are running and healthy

**Service Features:**
- **Desired count** - Number of tasks to keep running
- **Load balancer integration** - Distribute traffic across tasks
- **Auto scaling** - Scale tasks based on metrics
- **Rolling deployments** - Update tasks without downtime

### 4. Tasks
**Definition:** A running instance of a task definition

**Task Characteristics:**
- **Ephemeral** - Tasks can be stopped and started
- **Isolated** - Each task runs in its own environment
- **Scheduled** - Can run on-demand or on schedule
- **Monitored** - Health checks and logging included

## Key Features ⭐ **EXAM FOCUS**

### Fully Managed Service
- **No control plane management** - AWS handles the orchestration layer
- **Automatic scaling** - Scale containers based on demand
- **High availability** - Built-in fault tolerance across AZs
- **Integration** - Works seamlessly with other AWS services

### Flexible Launch Types
- **EC2 Launch Type** - Full control over underlying instances
- **Fargate Launch Type** - Serverless containers, no server management
- **Spot integration** - Use Spot instances for cost savings
- **Mixed workloads** - Run different types of workloads in same cluster

### Security and Compliance
- **IAM integration** - Fine-grained access control
- **VPC networking** - Secure network isolation
- **Secrets management** - Integration with AWS Secrets Manager

### Fargate Launch Type
**When to Use:**
- Want serverless container experience
- Don't want to manage underlying infrastructure
- Need to focus on application development
- Have variable or unpredictable workloads

**Characteristics:**
- **Serverless** - No EC2 instances to manage
- **Pay-per-use** - Pay only for vCPU and memory used
- **Automatic scaling** - AWS handles infrastructure scaling
- **Simplified operations** - Focus on containers, not servers
